<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Parv Patel</h1>
<h3 align="center">Currently, I am a graduate student at northeastern university, Majoring in Software Engineering Systems. I have completed my Bachelors in Information and Communication Technology Engineering at Pandit Deendayal Energy University. 

As experience, I have done two internships during my bachelor’s. First one, as a .Net developer in C# language where I was developing ERP and CRM softwares. My other internship was as Software Engineer Intern at monarch innovation where I was building Cross platform app using Javascript and Python.

Additionally, I have a conference paper for building 3D Viewer Tool Application for 3D BIN PACKING ALGORITHM at 3rd Asian Conference on Innovation Technology (ASIANCON). 

I am highly proficient in Javascript and Python language. I am also skilled in DBMS and OOCP concepts. I want to apply my skill and expertise toward designing and building efficient software which can provide solutions for industrial problems. I am a problem solver, avid reader, a cinephile, dedicated gamer and a sport enthusiast.</h3>
